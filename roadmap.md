# Project Roadmap: Archive Grid Display

## Project Overview
An archival display system for fashion brand imagery, featuring a full-screen interactive grid interface with quadrant-based image display.

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Basic proof-of-concept implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Image display issues identified
- üìÖ Planning phase for display optimization

## Objectives
1. Optimize full-screen image display
2. Maintain visual integrity across different viewport sizes
3. Preserve important image content
4. Ensure consistent user experience

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. No Padding Approach
- Implementation: Switch to `object-fit: contain`
- Key Features:
  - Uses `<img>` elements instead of background images
  - Shows complete images without cropping
  - Automatic letterboxing/pillarboxing as needed
- Status: To be evaluated
- Priority: High

### 2. Dynamic Focusing System
- Implementation: Smart scaling and positioning
- Key Features:
  - Viewport dimension calculations
  - Image dimension analysis
  - Intelligent positioning algorithms
  - Potential focal point system
- Status: To be evaluated
- Priority: Medium
- Complexity: High

### 3. Padding/Centering Solution
- Implementation: Consistent image margins
- Key Features:
  - Fixed padding from viewport edges
  - Centered image positioning
  - Maintained aspect ratios
  - Uniform spacing
- Status: To be evaluated
- Priority: High
- Complexity: Low

## Next Steps
- [ ] Evaluate each solution with test images
- [ ] Create prototype implementations
- [ ] Assess performance impact
- [ ] Document implementation details
- [ ] Make final approach selection

## Timeline
TBD based on solution selection and resource availability

## Notes
- Current implementation uses background-image with cover
- Mobile devices show alternative message
- JavaScript handles quadrant detection and image switching

## Technical Considerations
- Browser compatibility
- Performance optimization
- Image loading strategies
- Transition smoothness
